3D printing is a subject that we have been passionate about for many years. Because of that, we had the initiative to build our own 3D printer. We have come to the conclusion that more people should know this topic, so we decided to create a site to guide them for this purpose. The platform will contain information, tutorials and tests. On the one hand, we want to educate the public on the new possibilities to materialize our inventions by printing them. Thus, we will participate in an increase of some areas such as architecture, art, construction, robotics or even the culinary field. All this will lead to an increase in the need for 3D printers, which can come in different shapes and sizes. This increase in interest motivates us to deepen the subject and develop it. This is when we intervene both by providing organized information support for building a 3D printer and by printing services.
